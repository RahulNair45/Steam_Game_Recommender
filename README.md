# Personalized Game Recommendations Using Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering

This project explores two machine learning approaches—content-based filtering and collaborative filtering—to build a personalized video game recommendation system using player-game interaction data and game metadata. The content-based model uses player genre preferences to recommend unseen games, while the collaborative model leverages a denoising autoencoder to predict likely game interests based on masked game vectors. Both models showed significant improvements after training, with the content-based approach achieving superior performance in Top-5 recommendation accuracy (96.55%) compared to the collaborative model (86.49%). The final system effectively suggests games tailored to user preferences and behaviors, demonstrating the value of combining deep learning with recommender system techniques.
